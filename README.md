# Expo CLI Unexpected Error: Version Mismatch or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI: unexpected errors during project startup or the build process. These errors often stem from version inconsistencies between the Expo CLI, project dependencies, and/or native modules. 

## Problem

The `expo start` or `expo build` commands might fail with cryptic error messages, hindering project development and deployment.

## Solution

The primary solution involves ensuring all dependencies are compatible. This includes verifying the Expo CLI version, updating packages, and resolving potential conflicts between different modules.  Sometimes, a clean installation of node modules or even a project reset might be necessary.   Detailed steps are provided in the `expoBugSolution.js` file.
