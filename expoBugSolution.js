The solution involves a multi-step process to ensure compatibility:

1. **Update Expo CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```
2. **Update project dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Check package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock):**  Ensure there are no conflicting versions listed for dependencies, especially those that interact with native modules. Resolve any version conflicts or ambiguity.
4. **Clear and reinstall node_modules:**
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
5. **Clean the project (optional but often effective):**  Sometimes cached files can cause problems. Try deleting the `node_modules`, `.expo`, and possibly even the `ios` and `android` folders in your project before reinstalling dependencies.
6. **If problems persist:** If the above steps don't solve the issue, consider creating a new Expo project from scratch to rule out corruption in your existing project files. Compare your `package.json` with the new project's to identify discrepancies.
